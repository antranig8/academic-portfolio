# CMSC 203 – Object-Oriented Programming

This folder contains my projects and assignments for CMSC 203 (Object-Oriented Programming).  
The course focuses on Java fundamentals, OOP concepts, file I/O, debugging, testing, and building complete applications.

A simple command-line guessing game that demonstrates file handling, user interaction, loops, conditionals, and exporting runnable applications (JAR and EXE).

### 2. [Patient Management](PatientApp/)
A multi-class project demonstrating constructors, accessors/mutators, data formatting, composition, and basic charge calculations.

### 3. [CryptoManager](CryptoManager/)
Implements Vigenere and Playfair ciphers using Java, featuring string validation, encryption/decryption logic, a provided JavaFX GUI, and custom JUnit tests. Includes a runnable Windows app-image for easy execution.
