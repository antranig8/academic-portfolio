# Academic Portfolio

A collection of my academic coursework and programming projects completed throughout my studies at Montgomery College.  
This repository serves **only as a showcase of my skills, learning progress, and software development abilities**.  
It is **not** intended for redistribution, resale, or academic misuse of any kind.

All materials in this repository are provided strictly for **portfolio and demonstration purposes**.

---

## About This Portfolio
This repo contains my completed assignments, projects, and code implementations across multiple courses.  
Most of the work focuses on **Object-Oriented Programming (Java)**, **data structures**, **algorithmic thinking**, and **software engineering fundamentals**.

Each project folder includes:
- A clear project-specific README
- Source code (`.java`)
- Program structure demonstrating OOP principles
- Runnable artifacts when applicable (JAR / EXE builds)

---

## Course Work Included

### CMSC204 – Data Structures & Algorithms
This folder contains implementations and applications of fundamental data structures.

#### Course topics include:

## Academic Integrity Notice
All code in this repository represents **my own academic work**.  
It is uploaded **solely to document my skills for internships, employers, and personal development**.

To remain compliant with academic integrity standards:
- These files are **not to be submitted by anyone else** for coursework.
- Nothing in this repository is offered for sale or unauthorized distribution.
- I do **not** provide solutions, tutoring materials, or homework answers for others.
- Some starter files, interfaces, abstract classes, testing frameworks, or GUI templates used in certain assignments were originally provided by course instructors. I **do not claim ownership** over any instructor-provided starter code. My contributions consist of the logic, implementations, extensions, and completed functionality built on top of those materials.
